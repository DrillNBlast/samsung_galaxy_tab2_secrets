download 3.82 from http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make/
extract it and cd into the path,
now run:
./configure
./build.sh
sudo mv make `which make`
make --version

"I wouldn't replace global make
Put it in my local bin folder.
It'll take priority without breaking other package dependencies."

On arch
Arch uses python 3
Well to use python 2 all I did was
ln -s $(which python2) ~/bin/python


-------

./configure
./build.sh
sudo mv make ~/bin/
ln -s $(which make) ~/bin/make
make --version
