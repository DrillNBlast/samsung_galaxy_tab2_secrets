Backup-EFS by Hand
Maybe you´ll never need it - but you´ll be more then happy if you need it and a backup exist.

Download and run Terminal-Emulator:

# su
Grant root access.

# busybox dd if=/dev/block/mmcblk0p1 of=/sdcard/efs.img bs=4096
# exit

You´ll find "efs.img" on your internal Storage, copy to your PC & on a 2nd Storage (e.g. usb-stick) and keep it safe.


Restore EFS from "efs.img"

Only in case you need it - don´t try it "just-for-fun".
Open your Terminal-Emulator:

# su
# busybox dd if=/sdcard/efs.img of=/dev/block/mmcblk0p1 bs=4096
# exit
