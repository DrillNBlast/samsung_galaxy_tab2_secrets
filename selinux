How to fix denials?

1. you need su permissions
   $ adb root
2. get a dmesg, but only show the denials:
   $ adb shell su -c dmesg | grep 'avc: '

  or

   $ adb pull /data/misc/audit/audit.log

   Note: the ones you see in the first, let's say, 60seconds are the most important to fix 
         for refference https://source.android.com/devices/tech/security/selinux/validate.html 
         Don'tuse audit2allow, but this might help you to understand how to create policies.

3. keep on looking for the avc denials, not all get shown on boot..
   you might see some like 10 minutes after, who knows lol

4. That's how it works:
   allow %scontext %tcontext:%typ { %what };
